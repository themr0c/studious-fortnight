= User-replaced values

Ensure that user-replaced values have the following characteristics:

* Surrounded by angle brackets (`< >`)
* Separated by underscores (`_) for multi-word values
* Lowercase, unless the rest of the related text is uppercase or another capitalization scheme
* Italicized
* If the user-replaced value is referencing a value in code or in a command that is normally monospace, also use monospace for the user-replaced value
