Generating extended Vale alerts reports Use the results to identify the rule creating the most errors, and work on that rule. Most probably, start with the Spelling rule. Report alerts for one single rule. Maybe use custom output templates to generate a custom report. See Vale documentation - JSON output of checks and Vale documentation - --output. Consider aggregating alerts to identify the most common. Examine the report to distinguish legit alerts from false positives. Use the curated list of false positives to report an issue. For example, for the Spelling rule, create a report containing the list of all words reported by the Spelling rule, and count their occurrences. Use that list to differentiate false positives from legit errors. Use the curated list to report an issue.

By creating a GitHub Action workflow for Vale, you can configure how Vale runs: you can set Vale flags and specify which Git workflow events trigger Vale jobs. For example, you can decide to: Run Vale when a contributor creates a pull request. Run Vale on only the changes. Allow the merging of pull requests if the report has errors. Block the merging of pull requests if the report has errors. For a full list of supported configuration options, see Vale GitHub Action. Prerequisites Your content repository is on GitHub.
