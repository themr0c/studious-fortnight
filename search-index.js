Generating extended Vale alerts reports Use the results to identify the rule creating the most errors, and work on that rule. Most probably, start with the Spelling rule. Report alerts for one single rule. Maybe use custom output templates to generate a custom report. See Vale documentation - --output template. Consider aggregating alerts to identify the most common. Examine the report to distinguish legit alerts from false positives. Use the curated list of false positives to report an issue. For example, for the Spelling rule, create a report containing the list of all words reported by the Spelling rule, and count their occurrences. Use that list to differentiate false positives from legit errors. Use the curated list to report an issue.
